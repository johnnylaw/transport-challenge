## Transport Locomote Code Challenge

#### Errata:
1. If you don't select the airport from the dropdown lists, the form will not allow you to submit it (disabled button). With more time, it would be nice to fetch the airport given just a three-letter code in the text field and use that on blur.
2. I made some incorrect assumption about momentJS, which I'd never used before today, and sometimes the middle tab displays the wrong date (i.e. things are offset by a day one direction or the other from the date selected in the date picker). Time zones are a tricky deal! Just what you wanna hear from someone half way 'round the world looking for a remote job I'm sure!
